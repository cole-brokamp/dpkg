Description: Data frame, tibble, or tbl objects are converted to data package objects using specific metadata labels (name, version, title, homepage, description). A data package object (`dpkg`) can be written to disk as a 'parquet' file or released to a 'GitHub' repository. Data package objects can be read into R from online repositories and downloaded files are cached locally across R sessions.
