Description: Data frame, tibble, or tbl objects are converted to data package objects using specific metadata labels (name, version, title, homepage, description). A data package object (`dpkg`) can be written to disk as a 'parquet' file and uploaded to a 'Amazon Web Service' (AWS) 'Simple Storage Service' (S3) bucket or to a 'GitHub' release. Data package objects can be read into R from online repositories and the downloaded 'parquet' files are cached locally in the R user data directory.
